## 🛡️ Security & Architecture Notes

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Sidebar items based on user permissions from DB

### Performance Considerations  
- **Poor Internet**: Optimized for Syrian internet conditions
- **Image Optimization**: Cloudflare Images or similar CDN ready
- **Caching Strategy**: Server-side caching and CDN prepared
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading
